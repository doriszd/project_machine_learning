# Machine learning and Statistics - Project

### Author: Doris Zdravkovic


#### Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction. The goal is to produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. I will then develop a web service that will respond with predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests.


### Libraries used

#### Seaborn

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:

- A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables
- Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics
- Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data
- Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables
- Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets
- High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations
- Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes
- Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data
- Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.For more information about seaborn go to: https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html



#### Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

To install your jupyter notebook, you have to:

- Enter the startup folder by typing cd /folder_name .
- Run jupyter notebook command to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.
- In the top right corner press New, Python 3 to open new file in jupyter
- Click ESC and key shortcut m to markdown or double click the text in the cell if you want to edit.
- You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
- You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
- Closing the browser (or the tab) will not close the Jupyter Notebook App. To completely shut it down you need to close the associated terminal.
